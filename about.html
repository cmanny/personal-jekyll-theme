## About

I have interests in computer science, mathematics, and nature, to name a few.

I like to imagine and be open-minded. I'm also trying to write a few
posts now and again to record my thoughts before I forget them all.

"There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about.
It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work.
The trouble with computers is that you *play* with them!"
