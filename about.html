## About

I have many interests.

I don't live by any policy,
and I let my imagination run free wherever it likes to go.

"There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about.
It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work.
The trouble with computers is that you *play* with them!"

--- Feynman
