In this post I will attempt to explain a simplified variant of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD),
 while still highlighting all of the important ideas of the protocol.
I assume you at least recognise the terms cryptography and quantum.
Are you ready?

When dealing with protocols in cryptography, there is typically a secret
element, or key, which we would like to keep private. In the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad), Alice and Bob must share
a key in advance before they can use it (once). Let's assume however, that we are masters
of quantum theory and don't care for [key encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_encapsulation); we don't
want to rely on [computational hardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption).

The transition from bits to quantum bits (qubits) is not natural. Our
qubits can be in a superposition of 0's and 1's, for now you may just
believe that the qubit can encode information about both bits. Let's quickly
define some qubits:

\begin{align}
  \ket{+} &= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + \ket{1}) &
  \ket{-} &= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1}) &
  \ket{z} &= \ket{0}
\end{align}

Now the key idea here is that when we measure a qubit, the outcome
of the measurement has an associated probability of that outcome occurring
(additionally, the probability may be 1). When we measure qubits, we
use a [special type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator) of operator (matrix). The numerical outcome
of a measurement is one of the operators eigenvalues, and we can
access this information by writing operators in their spectral decomposition:
<div>
  \begin{align}
    Z &= 1\ket{0}\bra{0} - 1\ket{1}\bra{1}&
    X &= 1\ket{+}\bra{+} - 1\ket{-}\bra{-}& \\
    Z &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & -1 \\
    \end{bmatrix} & 
    X &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 1 \\
      1 & 0 \\
    \end{bmatrix} &
  \end{align}
</div>
