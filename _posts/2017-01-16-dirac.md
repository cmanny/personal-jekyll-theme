Dirac notation is a very elegant way to express
the state of quantum systems. For the inexperienced reader
the notation might seem intimidating, however
really it is quite simple as I
shall explain in this post. Notation in general
is only a means to an end, but if the notation
is really intuitive it can certainly speed up
problem solving. If you like this idea, you will
definitely enjoy 3Blue1Brown's video on the [Triangle
of Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck).
I assume you know some basics of linear algebra too,
if not, 3Blue1Brown also has some very good videos on that topic.

Dirac notation is pretty much exclusively used
in quantum mechanics and quantum information. Alternatively
 called bra-ket notation, as it uses the
 $\bra{\text{bra}}$ and the $\ket{\text{ket}}$. The ket
 is used to represent a vector, which may be a basis
 vector or a linear combination of them. Here are some
 examples:

 <div>
   \begin{align}
      \ket{0} &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
         1 \\
         0
        \end{bmatrix},
      &
      \ket{1} &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
         0 \\
         1
        \end{bmatrix},
      &
      \ket{x} &= \ket{0} - \ket{1} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\
        -1
        \end{bmatrix}
   \end{align}
 </div>

 Above we have assumed the *computational basis*, which is
 standard in quantum information texts. Now we turn our
 attention to the *bra*, which is the *conjugate transpose*
 of the ket, and vice versa. Below are the previous examples but as bras:

 <div>
   \begin{align}
      \bra{0} &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
         1 &
         0
        \end{bmatrix},
      &
      \bra{1} &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
         0 &
         1
        \end{bmatrix},
      &
      \bra{x} &= \bra{0} - \bra{1} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 &
        -1
        \end{bmatrix}
   \end{align}
 </div>
